## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was a challenging challenge to solve, as I'm still struggling to wrap my head around some of the underlying concepts of how grid layouts really works. Initially I didn't understand how I was supposed to get to that "plus-sign shaped" grid layout. Had to watch some additional tutorials, and read up on how spans work when laying out grids, and then suddenly something clicked and things started to fall in place. Grid spans to the rescue 🙏😎 I think beginning to understand this whole span-thing now 🥳

### Continued development

Might try to implement a layou suitable for screen sizes in in-between-range between mobile and desktop (two columns, 2x2 grid)

This CSS grid tutorial by Wes Bos was of tremendous help for helping me understand what's going on with the grid! Highly recommended 🙌
